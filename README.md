Reinforcement Learning with Pong in the browser via TensorFlow.js by @cpury üöÄ

Demo: https://cpury.github.io/pong-rl/ (select DQL-Controller with self-play and watch it learn the game in ~10 minutes!)

Blog post coming soon üìù

## Details

Implements a Pong-like game as well as a controller interface to add arbitrary controllers to the game.

### Available controllers:

- `KeyController` to controll via keyboard
- `DumbController` a simple controller that just follows the ball with some hiccups
- `DQLController` a first Deep-Q-Learning controller that learns on hard-coded features (position of the ball, force of the ball and positions of the paddles).

**In progress:** Visual interface and `VisualDQLController` that learns from pixels.

### Other features:

- Three difficulty levels
- Live mode: When disabled, learning happens without drawin or waiting for user

### Technologies used:

- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) for neural networks
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as CSS framework
- [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling

## Running locally

First install dependencies:

```sh

```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

## Contributing controllers

Contributions welcome! If you'd like to add a new controller, add a new class that inherits from `BaseController` and create a pull request.
